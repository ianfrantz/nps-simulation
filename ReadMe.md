Random Probability Simulation for Net Promoter Score

The following simulator breaks NPS down into it's essential three outcome elements and their assigned random probabilties based on a 10 point scale. They are:

Detractor Probability: 60%
Passive Probability: 20%
Promotoer Probability: 20%

No additional R Packages are needed to run this simulation. 

The default settings:

NPS Survey Sampling Distribution: 100
NPS Sample Score: x
Sample Mean of 5000 samples: nps
